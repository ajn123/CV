I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Engineer position at GitLab. With a strong background in software development and a passion for optimizing workflows, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to GitLab’s mission of enabling everyone to co-create the software that powers our world.

In my previous roles, I have focused on improving developer experiences by measuring and optimizing feedback loops, which aligns perfectly with the responsibilities of this position. I have successfully implemented quantitative and qualitative measures to identify areas for improvement, leading to enhanced workflow efficiency and productivity for development teams. My experience in building partnerships across organizational boundaries has allowed me to deliver broad efficiency improvements, ensuring that projects remain secure, compliant, and easy to work on for all contributors.  

I recently used Gitlab pipelines to run testing automation and code formatting for my side project runDMVrun.com which showcases run clubs and events in the DMV area.  I chose Laravel and PHP for this project but I understand that this job requires knowledge of Ruby which I have been using more of lately to build my lastest blog with Jekyll.

I am particularly drawn to GitLab’s commitment to running operations on its own product, as I believe this approach fosters a deep understanding of user needs and drives continuous improvement. I am eager to leverage my skills in backend development to contribute to the Developer Experience Team’s mission of maximizing the value and throughput of product development teams and community contributors.

My technical expertise includes proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks, as well as experience with DevSecOps practices. I am dedicated to constantly improving efficiency for engineering teams and am excited about the opportunity to measure what matters in terms of quality of life, efficiency, and toil reduction.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining GitLab and contributing to the ongoing success of your Developer Experience initiatives. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs.
