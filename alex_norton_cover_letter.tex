\indent Hello my name is Alex Norton.  I am seeking a \jobTitle
position with \companyName .  I graduated this May with a bachelor’s degree in
Computer Science and hands on experience with Ruby on Rails and Swift to create and
implement web and mobile applications.  Recently, I just finished my last
semester of undergrad studying in Oxford, England. 

Rather than me telling you what I have done, let me tell you what I can do for
you.  Hiring the wrong person wastes one of the most valuable resources to any
human, time.  As an employee, I want to learn from those more experienced 
than me and work with a team to understand and solve new challenges that will 
arise in the future.  With every triumph comes a new challenge and every 
developer must be willing to adapt to any new challenges \companyName \ will 
face in the future.  Whether that would be coders learning how to design or
learn new frameworks, one must evolve to face mightier problems.

I just finished launching my first iOS application on the app store.  It was called
OBU Transit.  I made the app to solve the problem of when and where the bus was
arriving at my university.  The app was made it easy to set reminders and see
the map of the bus schedule.  Along the way, I learned how to use Core Data,
NSConstraints, Cocoa pods, and a number of classes in UIKit.  

Lastly, let my state next that I truly love what I do.  In my spare time
I make YouTube videos of programming tips that I learn.  These videos
help me stay focused on what I am learning in class and help me review
later on.  Doing this has allowed to interact with other aspiring
programmers around the world and help them learn to code.  What draws me
to programming is that sort of interaction.  When you are on your
computer you can be a superhero.  You can move things around the world,
make people laugh, and change society all at your fingertips.

I am very interested in working for \companyName \  and would like the
opportunity to discuss a position with you.  My resume is enclosed. 
I will contact you in a week to ten days to answer any questions
you may have. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to
speaking to you about this opportunity.
